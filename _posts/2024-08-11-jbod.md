# The Frankenstein JBOD DAS Project

## The Idea

My current NAS/Storage server has a max capacity of 12 physical drives (HPE DL80 G9), today I'm using 10 of those available slots. Looking at the used market, the most affordable chassis that would hold at least 12 bays starts at around $300. While this is a decent price point, the usual models bring with it their own issues, primarily power consumption and noise from fans that were never intended to be in spaces with humans. 

The next closest thing I could find that fit the bill was a NetApp DS4246, sporting 24 3.5" drive bays. While tempting, and a likely upgrade path in the future, I decided to dig through the graveyard to see what I could bring back to life. Enter the SE3016

I picked up the SE3016 2016 for 120 bucks out the door, thinking I got a steal. Let's look at the out of the box limitations on this model

* SAS1 - old as hell
* Front facing external SAS connectors 
* ATX "compliant", but super old PSU with a super whiny 40mm fan
* No real management of any kind despite the rj45 network (not console) jack on the front
* 2 90mm spinnymotron rip-your-finger-off fans

The fans were replaced with a couple of corsair SP fans shortly after purchase, and it lived in that config, full of used/white label/refurb 2TB drives for a solid 5 years before I finally migrated the old array of 24x 2TB drives over to a 6x 18 array, later adding another 4x 16TB drives to a new to me DL80 G9, keeping all the drives in one chassis. I thought that would buy me a few more years of time.

It did not.

Now with the need to expand, and no additional physical bays to do so (and the constant desire to build cool stuff) we're here.


## The Hardware/BOM

* The SGI/Rackable 3U 16 Bay SE3016 itself (existing 120mm fan modification)
* WT32-eth01 ESP32 module and associated parts (listed below)
* Custom PCB for the ESP32
* 2x Noctua NF-F12 iPPC 3000 PWM 120mm fans + basic fan grills
* SFF8080 - SFF 8087 PCI passthrough card
* RJ45 Panel mount jack
* Seasonic FOCUS SPX-750 SFF PSU
* Intel RES2SV240 24 Port SAS2 expander

## The custom stuff


### The "IPMI" Controller

I really wanted this to be tightly integrated with home assistant, so with that in mind here's what we have: An esp32 ethernet module "wt32-eth01" (easily findable from the usual gettin spots) running esphome. Connected to that we have a few extra devices:

* 2x BME280 for temp and humidity monitoring
* 1x ADS1115 ADC paired with a SCT013-20A Split Core Current Transformer Sensor (current clamp) for energy monitoring at the device
* 1x SD1306 based 0.91" OLED Display (to mimic idrac/iLo front panel displays)
* 1x PCA9685 PWM controller, for easy fan rpm and LED PWM control
* 2x 2N3904TA NPN Transistors for monitoring "PSU Good" signal from the PSU, and sending "PSU Enable" signal to the PSU

The BMEs, ADS1115, and the OLED all live on their own breakout boards, wired back to the controller PCB via standard 0.1" crimped headers. The PCA9685 and the 2N3904TAs are soldered directly to the controller board.

### End Product

* Wired network connection to the esp32, home assistant for status and control
* Upgraded to SAS2 (backplane has no logic so this was possible)
* Front panel OLED, and reused leds (3x) and button
* Relocated SAS connectors to back
* Replaced PSU with high quality standard SFF
* Printed brackets for everything
* Custom molex cables for the backplanes
* PSU monitoring and control 
* Device energy monitoring
* Remote power control
* Remote fan control and monitoring
* Temp, humidity, and pressure monitoring
